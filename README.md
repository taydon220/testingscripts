# LPE card testing automation.
The original script was lpetestingwindows.py and it used only screen position coordinates to automate clicks to run through the tests for LPE cards.

With the upgrade to LpeTestingWindows1.3.py, the script is now fully image recognition based and will work with any screen resolution.

Other quality of life improvements were made as well such as adding a shutdown prompt to the end of the test, and adding confirmation alerts for the user to acknowledge before continuing to the next step.
